## HEP data entry generation

The package generates root files which contain the TGraph, TH1D and TH2D objects from the .C macros generated by root.
The .C files which produce the plots form EXO_24_004 are located in `./HEP_Data_Entries/ConvertCToRoot/paper_plots` folder.
The .root files are generated using `./HEP_Data_Entries/ConvertCToRoot/Convert.py` modifies the .C files so they save all the plots in the scripts into root 
files, stores them in `./HEP_Data_Entries/ConvertCToRoot/modified_files/` folder and runs them and saves the root files into `./HEP_Data_Entries/ConvertCToRoot/roots/` folder.
```
python3 Convert.py
```
The tarball is produced using `./HEP_Data_Entries/CreateTarBall/CreateTarBallSubmissionFile.ipynb` file which ueses the produced root files. 
The names of the graphs and histograms are written manually by looking for them in the root files. 

In the `PrivateCentralValidation` folder the comparison of samples from private and central production can be done. To perform the plotting of the distribution the `llp.C` macro is used. 
The script produces histograms and saves them in a root file in the same folder. As input data the ntuples are used and the address of the ntuple can be changed in `llp.h`. Once the 
histograms are produced the `Plotter.C` macro can be used to overlay the produced histograms and calculate the ratios for each bin, for which the filenames are provided manually in the macro.
